# Grav Comments Plugin

The **Comments Plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) adds the ability to add comments to pages, and moderate them.

| IMPORTANT!!! This plugin is currently in development as is to be considered a **beta release**.  As such, use this in a production environment **at your own risk!**. More features will be added in the future.

# Installation

The Comments plugin is easy to install with GPM.

```
$ bin/gpm install comments
```

Or clone from GitHub and put in the `user/plugins/comments` folder.

# TODO

- Add language file for the frontend
- Allow to moderate comments from the admin
- Email the comment to the site admins (default to all with admin.super, could be configured)
- Allow to enable on some taxonomies or page types only
- Allow some pages to disable comments
- Better presentation of the comments in Antimatter and other default themes
